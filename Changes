	- (Re-)observe option header_row. I didn't remmber why I changed it to
          _not_ observe header_row, probably because it makes Text::Table::CSV
          inadvertently produces "invalid" CSV; but there are valid reasons to
          want to omit the header row (for example, see RT#131101). Hence I'm
          adding this back.
